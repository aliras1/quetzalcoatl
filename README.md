## Docs

`docs/diagrams` contains the exported diagrams that describe the system.

`docs/uml-papyrus` contains a Papyrus project which includes the system's UML component diagram.
To open the project, you need to
* install [Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/download.html) and
* install [Carisma](https://rgse.uni-koblenz.de/carisma/install.shtml).

`docs/uml-staruml` contains a StarUML project which consists of the system's sequence diagrams. 
I (@aliras1) was unable to make Papyrus' sequence diagram editor work, thus I ditched it in favor of StarUML.
